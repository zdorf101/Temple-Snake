    I am a Cast Member and I have included a bunch of references
    to Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye!

    This attraction can be found at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Ca!
    The Temple Archeologists kindly refer to the giant snake as Fluffy.

    This game is a homage to my wonderful finance
    who worked this attraction for several years!
