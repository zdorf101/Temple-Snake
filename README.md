You will find this game really fun if you visit Disneyland often!
I am a Cast member and I have included a bunch of refferences to
Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye!


The temple archeologists kindly refer to the giant snake
as "Fluffy" so BEWWARE! This game is a homage to my wonderful
finance who worked this ride
for several years!  

Enjoy!

1) Start game by clicking "w" on your key board.
    
2) Use the "w", "s", "a", and "d" keys to help Fluffy (the snake) catch Indiana Jones!
