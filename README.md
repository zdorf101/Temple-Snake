TEMPLE SNAKE

    "Snakes, you guys are on your own." -Indiana Jones

    
Welcome to the Temple of the Forbidden Eye
    
    I am a Cast Member and I have included a bunch of references
    to the Indiana Jones Attraction at Disneland! The Temple
    Archeologists kindly refer to the giant snake as Fluffy.

    This game is a homage to my wonderful finance
    who worked this attraction for several years!
